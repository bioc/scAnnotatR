\title{Delete model/branch from package}
\usage{
delete_model(cell_type, path_to_models = tempdir())
}
\arguments{
\item{cell_type}{string indicating the cell type of which 
the model will be removed from package
Attention: deletion of a parent model will also delete all of child model.}

\item{path_to_models}{path to the folder containing 
the list of models in which the to-be-deleted model is.}
}
\value{
no return value, but the model is deleted from database
}
\description{
Delete model/branch from package
}
\examples{
# load small example dataset
data("tirosh_mel80_example")

# train a classifier
set.seed(123)
selected_marker_genes_T = c("CD4", "CD8A", "CD8B")
classifier_t <- train_classifier(train_obj = tirosh_mel80_example, 
marker_genes = selected_marker_genes_T, cell_type = "t cells")

# save a classifier to system
save_new_model(new_model = classifier_t, path_to_models = tempdir())

# delete classifier from system
